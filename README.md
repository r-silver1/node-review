Maybe not as elegant as the solution given above but it's fun to play around with and works as far as I can tell.

Usage:
```
-clone, open root folder in Node JS Command Prompt
-run node swap-strings.js <arguments>
--i.e node swap-strings.js west east wait
```

Output:
```
input:
[ 'west', 'east', 'wait' ]
change1:
[ 'west', 'wast', 'wait' ]
change2:
[ 'wast', 'wast', 'wait' ]
change3:
[ 'wast', 'wast', 'wast' ]
Number changes made: 3
```
